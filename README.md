# Who Wants To Be a Millionbear

Who Wants To Be a Millionbear is a CLI trivia game with a title and concept inspired by the well-known and loved, bears. It strives to bring life to the mundanity of the console with gratuitous use of ASCII and graphics, while still complementing the gameplay.

Users can test their trivia knowledge while our program showboats all over their console. But can you handle the pressure of avoiding embearassment in front of Alex Trebear? There's only one way to find out.


## Prerequisites
The following instructions are for macOS.

You will need Homebrew installed for the installation of an external dependency. https://brew.sh/

## Installation and Setup
First, clone or download the repository. There are Ruby scripts available for installing dependencies and initializing the database in the project directory.

For the full visual experience with graphics in the console, run `setup.rb`.
```sh
$ ruby setup.rb
```
For the lite version without graphics, run `setup_lite.rb`.
```sh
$ ruby setup_lite.rb
```

After installing dependencies, these scripts will run rake tasks to initialize the database by creating and seeding the tables.

## Usage
You can run the game by using the `run` rake task. For the best experience, we HIGHLY recommend you to zoom in once (just one tap of command +) in the terminal.
```sh
$ rake run
```

## Models

![flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/pO1IxTo.png)

This flowchart represents the model relationships for our database. The database is seeded prior to starting a game which populates the Questions table with questions from the Open Trivia Database API (https://opentdb.com/). When a game is started, a new GameSession is created which keeps track of the User's scores and guess record through UserGuesses. This allows us to keep track of the current and cumulative score for the User as they play, and rank them in a leaderboard after they complete a game session.

## Uninstall
You can uninstall the external dependency by running
```sh
$ ruby uninstall.rb
```
